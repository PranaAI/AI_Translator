# How to setup and run the AI Translator

## How to run locally on your PC
* Install PyCharm Community edition Or Install VS Code
* I prefer Pycharm because it creates the Virtual environment automatically
* But if your pc have less RAM then use VS Code, Pycharm will easily take 1.5 to 2.5 GB of RAM
* But for final running a simple terminal is enough so that RAM is consumed very less.


```shell
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
